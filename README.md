# SQL-Challenge-Employee-Tracker

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your challenge this week is to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
